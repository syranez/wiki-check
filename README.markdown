## Using

## Version scheme

The version scheme is this:

    {major-release}.{feature-release}.{bugfixes/maintaining}

 - Major release part

Changes that make your app crash if you update without modifying your code. The major release version is usally bumped if code structure changes happened, or something really exciting has happened. It breaks your stuff.

If you are using this module as dependency in live production apps, DO NOT wildcard this.

 - Feature release part

Introduces new features, that may work or not. You usually WANT this on development systems, but you DO NOT want this wildcarded in live production environments.

 - Bugfixes / maintaining part

Will be bumped everytime a bug is fixed or maintaining stuff (=all that does not break code, e. g. cosmetic code changes, comment stuff) has happend. You usually DO WANT bugs fixed on all your systems. Nothing is intended to break.

----------

If  you are unsure what to use:

 - Use __fixed__ version, e. g. 1.2.3, if you do not want any changes (fixes, features)
 - Use __bugfix channel__, e. g. ~1.2.3, if you just want bugfixes.
 - Use __feature channel__, e. g. 1. ** . **, if you want new features and can tolerate bugs.
 - Use __bleeding edge channel__ if you do not care about downtimes, breaks and bugs. You, Sir, are My best friend. Issue Tracker is open and I will answer your mails for sure.

If you are still not sure, use a fixed version.
